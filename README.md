## Usage Guide
### Step 1: Open Auto-Subs
Click on `Workspace` in Resolve's top menu bar, then within `Scripts` select `auto-subs` from the list.

    Workspace -> Scripts -> auto-subs

### Step 2: Create your Template
Add a `Text+` to the timeline, customise it to your liking, then drag it into the `Media Pool`. This will be used as the template for your subtitles.

### Step 3: Select an area to add subtitles
Mark the beginning ("In") and end ("Out") of the area to subtitle using the `I` and `O` keys on your keyboard.

### Step 4: Transcribe
Click **`"Generate Subtitles"`** to transcribe the selected timeline area.

## Automatic Setup
> [!NOTE] 
> **Automatic setup only works on Windows** - This will run a [PowerShell script](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/7e204b75b61081fb33168d5a50cb96e1a353ccc1/install-script.ps1) which installs Python (if not already installed), Whisper, FFMPEG, and Stable-TS.
> It also places the `auto-subs.py` file in the Fusion scripts folder so it can be accessed within Resolve.
1. Open PowerShell in **administrator mode**.
2. Copy this command into Powershell + Run it by hitting the enter key.

       Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/main/install-script.ps1").Content
3. Once finished running, the setup is complete!

## Manual Setup
### Summary:
1. Install [`Python 3.8 - 3.11`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [`OpenAI Whisper`](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
3. Install [`FFMPEG`](https://ffmpeg.org/) (used by Whisper for audio processing)
4. Install [`Stable-TS`](https://github.com/jianfch/stable-ts) (improves subtitles)
5. Download + copy [`auto-subs.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs.py) to Fusion Scripts folder.

### Setup Guides:
<details>
<summary>Windows Setup</summary>
       
### Step 1: Install Python
Download `Python 3.8 - 3.11` from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer. Make sure to tick `"Add python.exe to PATH"` during installation. <br>
If you are having issues, ensure that `Path` in your system environment variables contains `C:\Python311\` and `C:\Python311\Scripts\`.

### Step 2: Install Whisper
From the [Whisper setup guide](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main#readme) - Run the following command to install OpenAI Whisper for your OS.
    
    pip install -U openai-whisper

### Step 3: Install FFMPEG

Install [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) (for audio processing). I recommend using a package manager as it makes the install process less confusing.

    # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/install)
    choco install ffmpeg

    # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
    scoop install ffmpeg

### Step 4: Install Stable-TS
Install Stable-TS by running this command in the terminal:

    pip install -U stable-ts

### Step 5: Download the Python Script
Download the [`auto-subs.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs.py) file. Copy this file to the `Utility` folder within the Fusion `Scripts` folder. The directory should look like this:
  
    ...\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Utility

This directory can usually be found inside `C:\ProgramData\`.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Possible Error:** `<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1006)>` <br>
   > ‚úîÔ∏è **Solution:** Run this command in the terminal `/Applications/Python\ 3.11/Install\ Certificates.command` (replace the Python directory with wherever Python is installed on your computer).

4. Install [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) (used by Whisper for audio processing):

       brew install ffmpeg

## Light Version
> [!NOTE]
> **Audio transcription has been removed on this version**. This means less setup, but a subtitles (SRT) file is required as input. Use this if you already have a way of transcribing video (such as Davinci Resolve Studio's built-in subtitles feature, or CapCut subtitles) and you just want subtitles with a custom theme.

#### Creates themed subtitles from an SRT file.
### Step 1
Install any version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tick `"Add python.exe to PATH"` during installation)
### Step 2
Download **[`auto-subs-light.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs-light.py)** and place it in the `Utility` folder of the Fusion Scripts folder.

    ...\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Utility

## FAQ
### 1. Auto-Subs not opening
Verify that Resolve detects your Python installation by opening the Console from the top menu/toolbar in Resolve and clicking `py3` at the top of the console.
### 2. Can't find Fusion folder
Use [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) to quickly search your computer for it (Windows only).
### 3. MacOS Error
    <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1006)>
**Solution:** Run this command in the terminal (replace the Python directory with wherever Python is installed on your computer).

    /Applications/Python\ 3.11/Install\ Certificates.command
### 4. Check Python version being used by Resolve
`import sys` + `print (sys.version)` in the Resolve console.
### 5. Issues during Whisper setup
[This video](https://youtu.be/ABFqbY_rmEk) may help you (Only the first 6 minutes are necessary).

## Future Features
1. "Improve Timestamps" button to refine subtitle timing.
2. Speaker Diarization (different coloured subtitles for different people speaking).
3. Auto-translation (generate subtitles in a different language to the one being spoken).
4. ChatGPT Integration
