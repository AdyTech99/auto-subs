## Usage Guide
1. Open the `Workspace` menu within the top bar of Resolve, then select `auto-subs` from the `Scripts` dropdown.

       Workspace -> Scripts -> auto-subs
   
3. Add a timeline marker **(must be blue)** at the `start` and `end` of the segment to add subtitles.
4. Click `Generate Subtitles` in the script UI.

## Automatic Setup
> [!NOTE] 
> **Automatic setup only works on Windows** - This will run a PowerShell script which installs Python (if not already installed), Whisper, FFMPEG, and Stable-TS.
> It also places the `auto-subs.py` file in the Fusion scripts folder so it can be accessed within Resolve.
1. Open PowerShell in **administrator mode**.
2. Copy this command into Powershell + Run it by hitting the enter key.

       Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/main/install-script.ps1").Content
3. Once finished running, the setup is complete!

## Manual Setup
### Summary:
1. Install [`Python 3.8 - 3.11`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [`OpenAI Whisper`](https://github.com/openai/whisper) + [`FFMPEG`](https://ffmpeg.org/)
3. Install [`Stable-TS`](https://github.com/jianfch/stable-ts) (improves subtitles)
4. Download + copy [`auto-subs.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs.py) to Fusion Scripts folder.
### Step 1: Install Python
Download `Python 3.8 - 3.11` from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer.
> [!WARNING] 
> **During installation on Windows, make sure to tick `"Add python.exe to PATH"`.** <br/>
> If you are having issues, ensure that `Path` in your system environment variables contains `C:\Python311\` and `C:\Python311\Scripts\`.

### Step 2: Install Whisper
From the [Whisper setup guide](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main#readme) - Run the following command to install OpenAI Whisper for your OS.
    
    pip install -U openai-whisper

Then install [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) using your preferred method (needed for audio processing). I recommend using a package manager to install FFMPEG as the process can be quite confusing otherwise:

    # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
    brew install ffmpeg
    
    # on Ubuntu or Debian
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

    # on Arch Linux
    sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

    # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/install)
    choco install ffmpeg

    # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
    scoop install ffmpeg

### Step 3: Install Stable-TS
Install Stable-TS by running this command in the terminal:

    pip install -U stable-ts

### Step 4: Download the Python Script
Download the [`auto-subs.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs.py) file. Copy this file to the `Utility` folder within the Fusion `Scripts` folder. The directory should look like this:
  
    ...\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Utility

This directory can be found inside `C:\ProgramData\` on Windows.

## Light Version
> [!WARNING]
> Possibly broken - not updated in a long time. Will fix soon.

A simplified version with **no audio transcription**. No external libraries are needed. Generates subtitles on the timeline in your custom style from **a given SRT file**.
  1. Install any version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tick `"Add python.exe to PATH"` during install)
  2. Download **[`auto-subs-light.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs-light.py)** and place it in the `Utility` folder of the Fusion Scripts folder.

         ...\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Utility

## Help
1. **Auto-Subs not opening:** Verify that Resolve detects your Python installation by opening the Console from the top menu/toolbar in Resolve and clicking `py3` at the top of the console.
2. **Can't find Fusion folder:** Use [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) to quickly search your computer for it (Windows only).
3. Check Python version being used by Resolve: `import sys` + `print (sys.version)` in the Resolve console.

If you wish to create your own Python script for Davinci Resolve, **DON'T**. It's not worth it, the documentation is hell and I was literally working off scraps for this project.
